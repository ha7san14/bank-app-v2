# DevBank: Bank App
## Overview
Devbank is a modern online banking platform designed for seamless user experiences. It supports two user roles: Admin and Customer. Admins can create new users, edit or delete existing users, and oversee customer accounts and transactions. Customers can perform essential banking functions such as fund transfers, transaction tracking, viewing their profile, and changing their password. The platform ensures secure access and interactions through JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication and authorization.
