# DevBank: Bank App
## Overview
Devbank is a modern online banking platform designed for seamless user experiences. It supports two user roles: Admin and Customer. Admins can create new users, edit or delete existing users, and oversee customer accounts and transactions. Customers can perform essential banking functions such as fund transfers, transaction tracking, viewing their profile, and changing their password. The platform ensures secure access and interactions through JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication and authorization.

### Security:


* JWT Authentication: The application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users. Upon logging in, the backend generates a JWT, which is securely stored on the frontend (e.g., in localStorage). This token is included in subsequent server requests to verify user identity. <br/>
* Role-based Access Control: There are two roles: Admin and Customer. Specific routes and functionalities are protected based on the userâ€™s role. <br/>
